1. Variable provides a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset

2. The slope of the linear model is not considered zero, because 

3. This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototype effectively because the multiple R-squared is small, 0.07923.

Based on the Total summary table above, the variance is 62.29, which meets the design specification of 100 pounds per sqaure inch. 

### Lot summary

Based on the Lot summary table above, the variance of suspension coils for lots 1 and 2 are both less than 100 pounds per square inch.  However, the variance for lot 3 is 170.29, which fails to meet the design specification.
